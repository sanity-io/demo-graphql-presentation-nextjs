> [!NOTE]  
> This demo is setup with GraphQL, [there's also a simpler version that uses GROQ.](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/cms-sanity#readme)

## Features

- Uses URQL to query the GraphQL API
- Demonstrates how to use [`sanity/presentation`][presentation] and Visual Editing without GROQ.
- Out of the box support for [Vercel Visual Editing](https://www.sanity.io/blog/visual-editing-sanity-vercel?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=may-vercel-launch).

## Demo

### [https://demo-graphql-presentation-nextjs.sanity.build/](https://demo-graphql-presentation-nextjs.sanity.build/)

## Deploy your own

Use the Deploy Button below, you'll deploy the example using [Vercel](https://vercel.com?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=next-example).

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)][vercel-deploy]

## How to use

Execute [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) with [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/init), [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/create/), or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) to bootstrap the example:

```bash
npx create-next-app --example https://github.com/sanity-io/demo-graphql-presentation-nextjs sanity-graphql-presentation
```

```bash
yarn create next-app --example https://github.com/sanity-io/demo-graphql-presentation-nextjs sanity-graphql-presentation
```

```bash
pnpm create next-app --example https://github.com/sanity-io/demo-graphql-presentation-nextjs sanity-graphql-presentation
```

- [Next steps](#next-steps)

## Step 1. Set up the environment

### Reuse remote envionment variables

If you started with [deploying your own](#deploy-your-own) then you can run this to reuse the environment variables from the Vercel project and skip to the next step:

```bash
npx vercel link
npx vercel pull
```

### Using the Sanity CLI

Copy the `.env.local.example` file to `.env.local` to get started:

```bash
cp -i .env.local.example .env.local
```

Run the setup command to get setup with a Sanity project, dataset and their relevant environment variables:

```bash
npm run setup
```

```bash
yarn setup
```

```bash
pnpm setup
```

You'll be asked multiple questions, here's a sample output of what you can expect:

```bash
Need to install the following packages:
sanity@3.30.1
Ok to proceed? (y) y
You're setting up a new project!
We'll make sure you have an account with Sanity.io.
Press ctrl + C at any time to quit.

Prefer web interfaces to terminals?
You can also set up best practice Sanity projects with
your favorite frontends on https://www.sanity.io/templates

Looks like you already have a Sanity-account. Sweet!

âœ” Fetching existing projects
? Select project to use Templates [r0z1eifg]
? Select dataset to use graphql
? Would you like to add configuration files for a Sanity project in this Next.js folder? No

Detected framework Next.js, using prefix 'NEXT_PUBLIC_'
Found existing NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID, replacing value.
Found existing NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET, replacing value.
```

It's important that when you're asked `Would you like to add configuration files for a Sanity project in this Next.js folder?` that you answer `No` as this example is alredy setup with the required configuration files.

#### Creating a read token

This far your `.env.local` file should have values for `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET`.
Before you can run the project you need to setup a read token (`SANITY_API_READ_TOKEN`), it's used for authentication when Sanity Studio is live previewing your application.

1. Go to [manage.sanity.io](https://manage.sanity.io/) and select your project.
2. Click on the `ðŸ”Œ API` tab.
3. Click on `+ Add API token`.
4. Name it "next blog live preview read token" and set `Permissions` to `Viewer` and hit `Save`.
5. Copy the token and add it to your `.env.local` file.

```bash
SANITY_API_READ_TOKEN="<paste your token here>"
```

Your `.env.local` file should look something like this:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID="r0z1eifg"
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET="graphql"
SANITY_API_READ_TOKEN="sk..."
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_GRAPHQL_TAG="default"
```

> [!CAUTION]  
> Make sure to add `.env.local` to your `.gitignore` file so you don't accidentally commit it to your repository.

#### Deploy the GraphQL API

Run this command to deploy the GraphQL API:

```bash
npm run graphql:deploy
```

```bash
yarn graphql:deploy
```

```bash
pnpm graphql:deploy
```

## Step 2. Run Next.js locally in development mode

```bash
npm install && npm run dev
```

```bash
yarn install && yarn dev
```

```bash
pnpm install && pnpm dev
```

Your blog should be up and running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)! If it doesn't work, post on [the Slack community](https://slack.sanity.io/).

## Step 3. Populate content

Open your Sanity Studio that should be running on [http://localhost:3000/studio](http://localhost:3000/studio).

By default you're taken to the [Presentation tool][presentation], which has a preview of the blog on the left hand side, and a list of documents on the right hand side.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> For each post record, you need to click **Publish** after saving for it to be visible outside Draft Mode. In production new content is using [Time-based Revalidation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/fetching-caching-and-revalidating#time-based-revalidation), which means it may take up to 1 minute before changes show up. Since a stale-while-revalidate pattern is used you may need to refresh a couple of times to see the changes.

## Step 4. Deploy to production

> [!NOTE]  
> If you already [deployed with Vercel earlier](#deploy-your-own) you can skip this step.

To deploy your local project to Vercel, push it to [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/importing-your-projects-to-github/importing-source-code-to-github/adding-locally-hosted-code-to-github)/GitLab/Bitbucket and [import to Vercel](https://vercel.com/new?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=next-example).

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> When you import your project on Vercel, make sure to click on **Environment Variables** and set them to match your `.env.local` file.

After it's deployed link your local code to the Vercel project:

```bash
npx vercel link
```

> [!TIP]
> In production you can exit Draft Mode by clicking on _"Back to published"_ at the top. On [Preview deployments](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/preview-deployments) you can [toggle Draft Mode in the Vercel Toolbar](https://vercel.com/docs/workflow-collaboration/draft-mode#enabling-draft-mode-in-the-vercel-toolbar).
